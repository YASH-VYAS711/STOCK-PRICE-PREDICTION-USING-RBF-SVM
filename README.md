# STOCK-PRICE-PREDICTION-USING-RBF-SVM
This project focused on predicting stock prices using a Radial Basis Function Support Vector Machine (RBF-SVM), leveraging historical
data to enhance financial analysis and inform investment decisions. The dataset, comprising Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock data from January
1, 2020, to January 1, 2023, was collected from Yahoo Finance and included daily open, high, low, close prices, and trading volume.
The data underwent thorough preprocessing to address missing values and normalize features, ensuring it was suitable for model
training. RBF-SVM was selected for its strength in handling non-linear relationships and high-dimensional data, making it particularly
effective for complex financial datasets. The project involved splitting the data into training and testing sets, optimizing hyperparameters
to improve the model's predictive accuracy, and evaluating performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and visual comparisons
between actual and predicted prices. The results demonstrated that the RBF-SVM model effectively captured trends and patterns in
stock prices, offering a valuable tool for investors and analysts
